# Understanding ERC-777 Token Standard

ERC-777 is a token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It was designed to offer a richer set of features compared to the widely used ERC-20 token standard. The main problems that ERC-777 aims to solve include:

- **Lack of Advanced Interactions**: ERC-20 does not support advanced interactions during the token transfer process. For example, there is no built-in mechanism for notifying receivers when tokens are sent to them.

- **Over-Approval Issue**: With ERC-20, users have to approve token transfers, which can lead to an over-approval problem where more tokens can be transferred than intended.

- **Inefficiencies**: ERC-20 transactions often require two separate steps for approval and transfer, which can be inefficient.

### Features of ERC-777

To solve these issues, ERC-777 introduces features like:

- **Hooks**: These are functions that are automatically called when tokens are sent or received. This enables more complex interactions with tokens.

- **Default operator**: This allows the creator of a token contract to specify default operators who can send and burn tokens on behalf of other addresses.

- **Backwards compatibility**: ERC-777 is compatible with ERC-20, meaning that existing ERC-20 infrastructure can be upgraded to support ERC-777.

# Understanding ERC-1363 Payable Token Standard

While ERC-777 improves upon ERC-20, there was still a need for a token standard that could invoke a function in a smart contract by spending tokens. ERC-1363 was introduced to solve this problem.

### Features of ERC-1363

ERC-1363 extends the functionality of ERC-20 tokens by:

- **Enabling token "spending"**: ERC-1363 tokens can be used to pay for the execution of functions in other smart contracts, similar to how Ether is used to pay for gas on Ethereum.

- **Adding callback functions**: The receiver of ERC-1363 tokens can define callback functions that trigger when tokens are transferred or approved.

### Issues with ERC-777

Despite its advances, ERC-777 has several known issues:

- **Reentrancy Attacks**: ERC-777 tokens are susceptible to reentrancy attacks. For example, this vulnerability was exploited in an attack on the Uniswap exchange.

- **Complexity**: The advanced functionality and complexity of ERC-777 can make it harder for developers to use correctly, which can potentially introduce bugs and security issues.

- **Potential misuse of Default Operators**: Default operators, if not implemented correctly, can potentially abuse their powers over users' tokens.
