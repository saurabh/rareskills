## Off-chain Indexing for NFT Ownership

When creating an NFT marketplace, it's important to provide efficient ways to determine the NFTs owned by a specific address, especially when the NFTs don't use ERC721 enumerable. One approach to achieve this is by implementing off-chain indexing. Here's an outline of the process:

1. **Event Tracking**: Emit events in your NFT contract whenever a transfer or ownership-related action occurs. These events should include the relevant information such as the token ID and the involved addresses.

2. **Event Subscriptions**: Set up an off-chain system to subscribe to these events. This system could use a tool like The Graph, which provides indexing and querying capabilities for blockchain data.

3. **Indexing and Database**: Configure the off-chain system to index the emitted events and update a database that associates addresses with their owned NFTs. Each time a relevant event is received, the system should update the ownership records accordingly.

4. **API and Querying**: Provide a public API that allows users to query for the NFTs owned by a specific address. This API can interact with the off-chain database and return the list of owned NFTs based on the address provided.

By implementing this off-chain indexing solution, OpenSea, or any other NFT marketplace, can quickly determine the NFTs owned by a particular address. The off-chain system continuously updates the ownership records based on the emitted events, allowing for efficient querying and providing real-time ownership information.

This approach eliminates the need for on-chain enumeration, which can be gas-intensive and inefficient, especially when dealing with a large number of NFTs. Instead, the off-chain indexing solution offloads the ownership tracking and querying to an external system, optimizing performance and scalability.

Please note that the above is a high-level overview of the approach, and the actual implementation details may vary based on the chosen indexing and querying tools. It's recommended to consult the documentation of the selected tools and frameworks for more specific implementation guidance.
