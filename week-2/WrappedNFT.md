# Wrapped NFT Pattern Use Cases

The wrapped NFT pattern, also known as the "ERC20-wrapped NFT" pattern, provides a way to represent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as fungible tokens (ERC20 tokens). While the pattern is commonly used for interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems or within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, there are several other use cases where the wrapped NFT pattern can be beneficial. Let's explore some of these use cases:

## 1. Fractional Ownership

By wrapping an NFT, it becomes divisible into smaller units, allowing for fractional ownership. This fractional ownership enables shared ownership of high-value NFTs, making them more accessible to a wider audience. Users can own a fraction of an NFT, represented by ERC20 tokens, and participate in the value appreciation or utility benefits of the underlying NFT.

## 2. Enhanced Liquidity

Wrapping NFTs as ERC20 tokens can significantly increase liquidity in the market. It enables NFT holders to trade, exchange, and use their NFTs in various DeFi protocols or decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that primarily support ERC20 tokens. This broader liquidity pool opens up more opportunities for NFT holders to monetize or leverage their assets.

## 3. Collateral for Loans

The wrapped NFT pattern allows NFT owners to use their assets as collateral for loans in DeFi lending platforms. By wrapping an NFT, it becomes compatible with lending protocols that primarily deal with ERC20 tokens. NFT holders can lock their wrapped NFTs as collateral and borrow funds against their value, providing them with additional liquidity without needing to sell their NFTs.

## 4. Gamification and Rewards

The wrapped NFT pattern can be utilized in gamification and rewards systems. By representing NFTs as ERC20 tokens, game developers can integrate them into in-game economies, reward systems, or loyalty programs. This provides players with fungible tokens that can be easily traded, exchanged, or used within the game's ecosystem.

## 5. Cross-Chain Interoperability

Wrapped NFTs enable interoperability between different blockchain networks. By wrapping an NFT from one blockchain and representing it as an ERC20 token, it becomes compatible with Ethereum-based applications and protocols. This allows NFTs from other blockchain ecosystems to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, opening up new possibilities for cross-chain composability.

## 6. Risk Mitigation and Insurance

The wrapped NFT pattern can be used to create insurance products for NFTs. By representing NFTs as ERC20 tokens, insurance providers can create insurance pools and coverage for specific NFTs or collections. NFT owners can purchase insurance using ERC20 tokens, mitigating the risk of loss or damage to their valuable assets.

These are just a few examples of the potential use cases for the wrapped NFT pattern. The versatility of the pattern allows for innovative applications across various industries, leveraging the benefits of both NFTs and ERC20 tokens. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more creative uses of the wrapped NFT pattern in the future.
